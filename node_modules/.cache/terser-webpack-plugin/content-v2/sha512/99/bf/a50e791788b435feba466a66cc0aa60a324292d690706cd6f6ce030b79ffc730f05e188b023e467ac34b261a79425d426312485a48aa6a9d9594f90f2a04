The human eye becomes dryer as we age, making the use of contact lenses more uncomfortable. Certain types of employment require excellent vision without corrective devices. In other jobs, the use of glasses may be inconvenient. LASIK, laser eye surgery, offers the potential to reduce dependence on glasses and contact lenses or, in many cases, eliminate them all together.

The patient remains awake and pain free during the treatment. Prior to treatment, the patient is lead into the treatment room and positioned in a comfortable chair where anesthetic eye drops will be administered. Using the Ziemer Crystal Line Femto Laser, a corneal flap is created one eye at a time at less than a minute per eye. The corneal flap is then lifted, and using the Nidek EC-5000, a laser beam is applied to the exposed surface of the cornea to re-shape the tissue. The flap is then replaced over the treated area. This corneal flap serves as a natural bandage, which eliminates the discomfort associated with other types of refractive surgery, and expedites the healing process.
