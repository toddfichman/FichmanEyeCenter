You’ve probably heard a lot about your options, but the\n            truth is that laser-assisted surgery is proven to be more precise\n            and reproducible than traditional cataract surgery. Cataract\n            refractive surgery can help you get back to the lifestyle you love\n            with improved vision.\n          </p>\n          <h3 className=\"list-header\">\n            Developing a personalized treatment plan\n          </h3>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            While our eyes share the same basic anatomy, each eye is unique when\n            it comes to certain key measurements. Before your cataract\n            procedure, the technology behind the LenSx® Laser captures\n            high-resolution images of your eyes. These images help your surgeon\n            plan and complete a procedure to exacting specifications not\n            possible with traditional cataract surgery.\n          </p>\n          <h3 className=\"list-header\">A precise procedure</h3>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            The LenSx® Laser system takes real-time video and generates\n            three-dimensional images of your eye to help your surgeon automate\n            and execute the challenging steps of cataract surgery. Laser\n            fragmentation helps the surgeon remove the cataract precisely and\n            efficiently while limiting stress to your eye.\n          </p>\n          <h3 className=\"list-header\">\n            Cataract refractive surgery is designed to help you see the world\n            better\n          </h3>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            After laser fragmentation of your lens, your cataract is removed and\n            an artificial replacement lens, or IOL, is inserted to help you see\n            clearly again. Many patients experience improved vision after two\n            weeks, and they approach optimal vision between two and four months\n            after their procedure.\n          </p>\n\n          <h3 className=\"list-header\">\n            Reduce your dependence on glasses with advanced technology lenses\n          </h3>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            The LenSx® Laser can also be used with advanced technology IOLs,\n            which are designed to help you enjoy less dependence on spectacles\n            during activities such as:\n            <ul className=\"list-group\">\n              <li className=\"list-item\">&rarr; Knitting</li>\n              <li className=\"list-item\">&rarr; Reading</li>\n              <li className=\"list-item\">&rarr; Playing cards</li>\n              <li className=\"list-item\">&rarr; Watching TV</li>\n              <li className=\"list-item\">&rarr; Playing golf and tennis</li>\n            </ul>\n          </p>\n\n          <h3 className=\"list-header\">What is the LenSx® Laser?</h3>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            The system is designed to automate some of the most demanding steps\n            of cataract refractive surgery and offers:\n            <ul className=\"list-group\">\n              <li className=\"list-item\">&rarr; A laser procedure</li>\n              <li className=\"list-item\">\n                &rarr; Precise, reproducible performance\n              </li>\n              <li className=\"list-item\">&rarr; Increased surgeon control</li>\n              <li className=\"list-item\">\n                &rarr; More predictable surgical outcomes\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </p>\n\n          <h3 className=\"list-header\">\n            Investing in the added value of laser procedures\n          </h3>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            Medicare and private insurance typically cover some of the costs of\n            cataract surgery. However, there may be out-of-pocket expenses\n            involved because of the premium nature of a laser-assisted cataract\n            procedure. Even so, many patients still choose laser-assisted\n            cataract refractive surgery.\n          </p>\n\n          \n\n\n          <Link href='/about/testimonials' id=\"visible-link-large\">Hear Testimonials Here</Link>\n\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n\n      <Row className=\"slogan-section\">\n        <Slogan />\n      </Row>\n    </Grid>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default CataractSurgery;\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAIA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AASA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AACA;AACA;AAFA;AADA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAWA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAtHA;AACA;AA2HA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
