The laser is able to precisely\n            shape or sculpt the corneal tissue.\n          </p>\n\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            The first LASIK Surgery in the state of Connecticut was performed at\n            the Fichman Eye Center in the mid 90’s.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            Fichman Eye Center was first to perform LASIK Surgery using\n            bladeless technology in the state of Connecticut.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            Celebrities who have undergone Lasik surgery: Jessica Simpson, Elton\n            John, Nicole Kidman, Troy Aikman, Michael Bolton, Drew Carey,\n            Lorenzo Lamas, Courtney Cox, John Tesh, Ozzy Osbourne, Steven Tyler,\n            Rick Fox and Tiger Woods.\n          </p>\n          <VideoPlayer src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cw8TwIaIOv4\" />\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n\n      <Row className=\"slogan-section\">\n        <Slogan />\n      </Row>\n    </Grid>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default FAQs;\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAIA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AACA;AACA;AAFA;AADA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAUA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAgBA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAhHA;AACA;AAqHA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
