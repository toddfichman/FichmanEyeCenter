The best\n            candidates tend to be people who are dissatisfied with their contact\n            lenses or glasses and are motivated to make a change, whether itâ€™s\n            due to occupational or lifestyle reasons. There are certain medical\n            conditions such as glaucoma, pregnancy, keratoconus, connective\n            tissue disease, etc. that may exclude a potential patient.\n          </p>\n\n          <h3 className=\"list-header\">How painful is the procedure?</h3>\n\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            The treatment itself is painless, although the patient may notice a\n            pressure sensation in the eye or some discomfort in the first 24-48\n            hours. Medication may be provided to minimize any post-surgical\n            discomfort\n          </p>\n          <h3 className=\"list-header\">\n            How long does the laser treatment take?\n          </h3>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            Depending upon the amount of correction required, the laser\n            treatment itself lasts less than 2 minutes.\n          </p>\n          <h3 className=\"list-header\">How soon can I go back to work?</h3>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            Typically, the patient will notice improved vision within 24 hours\n            and can usually resume normal activities in 1-3 days. Vision may\n            fluctuate over the next few weeks, and usually stabilizes within\n            three months. Most patients do return to work the next day.\n          </p>\n          <h3 className=\"list-header\">What are the risks?</h3>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            As with any surgery, including vision correction, there is a risk of\n            infection. Dr. Fichman uses every precaution to prevent infection at\n            the time of treatment. This includes prescribing antibiotics after\n            treatment to prevent infection. With proper post-operative care, the\n            percentage of infection drops significantly.\n          </p>\n          <h3 className=\"list-header\">Glare, Halos & Double Vision?</h3>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            Early side effects of any corneal treatment include light\n            sensitivity and glare. These symptoms are usually gone within days\n            of treatment, but they have been reported to last for months. At\n            Fichman Eye Center, we make every effort to avoid these side effects\n            by carefully measuring the size of your pupil in darkness (maximum\n            diameter 8 millimeters), which prevents halos and glare by\n            containing the treated area within the pupil size\n          </p>\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n\n      <Row className=\"slogan-section\">\n        <Slogan />\n      </Row>\n    </Grid>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default FAQs;\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AACA;AACA;AAFA;AADA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAUA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAYA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AA/EA;AACA;AAoFA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
