Treatment.</strong> Our practice may use your IIHI to\n            treat you. For example, we may ask you to have laboratory tests\n            (such as blood or urine tests), and we may use the results to help\n            us reach a diagnosis. We might use your IIHI in order to write a\n            prescription for you, or we might disclose your IIHI to a pharmacy\n            when we order a prescription for you. Many of the people who work\n            for our practice – including, but not limited to, our doctors and\n            nurses – may use or disclose your IIHI in order to treat you or to\n            assist others in your treatment. Additionally, we may disclose your\n            IIHI to others who may assist in your care, such as your spouse,\n            children or parents\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            Finally, we may also disclose your IIHI to other health care\n            providers for purposes related to your treatment.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            <strong>2. Payment.</strong> Our practice may use and disclose your\n            IIHI in order to bill and collect payment for the services and items\n            you may receive from us. For example, we may contact your health\n            insurer to certify that you are eligible for benefits (and for what\n            range of benefits), and we may provide your insurer with details\n            regarding your treatment to determine if your insurer will cover, or\n            pay for, your treatment. We also may use and disclose your IIHI to\n            obtain payment from third parties that may be responsible for such\n            costs, such as family members. Also, we may use your IIHI to bill\n            you directly for services and items. We may disclose your IIHI to\n            other health care providers and entities to assist in their billing\n            and collection efforts.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            <strong>3. Health Care Operations.</strong> Our practice may use and\n            disclose your IIHI to operate our business. As examples of the ways\n            in which we may use and disclose your information for our\n            operations, our practice may use your IIHI to evaluate the quality\n            of care you received from us, or to conduct cost-management and\n            business planning activities for our practice. We may disclose your\n            IIHI to other health care providers and entities to assist in their\n            health care operations.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            <strong>4. Appointment Reminders.</strong> Our practice may use and\n            disclose your IIHI to contact you and remind you of an appointment.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            <strong>5. Treatment Options.</strong> Our practice may use and\n            disclose your IIHI to inform you of potential treatment options or\n            alternatives.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            <strong>6.

Release of Information to Family/Friends.</strong> Our\n            practice may release your IIHI to a friend or family member that is\n            involved in your care, or who assists in taking care of you. For\n            example, a parent or guardian may ask that a babysitter take their\n            child to the pediatrician’s office for treatment of a cold. In this\n            example, the babysitter may have access to this child’s medical\n            information.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            <strong>8.
