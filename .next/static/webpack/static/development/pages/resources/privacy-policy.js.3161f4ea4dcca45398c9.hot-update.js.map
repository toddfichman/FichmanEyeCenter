Treatment.</strong> Our practice may use your IIHI to\n            treat you. For example, we may ask you to have laboratory tests\n            (such as blood or urine tests), and we may use the results to help\n            us reach a diagnosis. We might use your IIHI in order to write a\n            prescription for you, or we might disclose your IIHI to a pharmacy\n            when we order a prescription for you. Many of the people who work\n            for our practice – including, but not limited to, our doctors and\n            nurses – may use or disclose your IIHI in order to treat you or to\n            assist others in your treatment.

Payment.</strong> Our practice may use and disclose your\n            IIHI in order to bill and collect payment for the services and items\n            you may receive from us. For example, we may contact your health\n            insurer to certify that you are eligible for benefits (and for what\n            range of benefits), and we may provide your insurer with details\n            regarding your treatment to determine if your insurer will cover, or\n            pay for, your treatment. We also may use and disclose your IIHI to\n            obtain payment from third parties that may be responsible for such\n            costs, such as family members. Also, we may use your IIHI to bill\n            you directly for services and items.

We may disclose your\n            IIHI to other health care providers and entities to assist in their\n            health care operations.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            <strong>4.

Release of Information to Family/Friends.</strong> Our\n            practice may release your IIHI to a friend or family member that is\n            involved in your care, or who assists in taking care of you. For\n            example, a parent or guardian may ask that a babysitter take their\n            child to the pediatrician’s office for treatment of a cold. In this\n            example, the babysitter may have access to this child’s medical\n            information.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            <strong>8.

Our practice may charge a fee for the costs of\n            copying, mailing, labor and supplies associated with your request.\n            Our practice may deny your request to inspect and/or copy in certain\n            limited circumstances; however, you may request a review of our\n            denial. Another licensed health care professional chosen by us will\n            conduct reviews.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            <strong>4. Amendment.</strong> You may ask us to amend your health\n            information if you believe it is incorrect or incomplete, and you\n            may request an amendment for as long as the information is kept by\n            or for our practice. To request an amendment, your request must be\n            made in writing and submitted to OFFICE MANAGER, 178 Hartford Road,\n            Manchester, CT, 06040, Telephone 860-649-9973. You must provide us\n            with a reason that supports your request for amendment. Our practice\n            will deny your request if you fail to submit your request (and the\n            reason supporting your request) in writing. Also, we may deny your\n            request if you ask us to amend information that is in our opinion:\n            (a) accurate and complete; (b) not part of the IIHI kept by or for\n            the practice; (c) not part of the IIHI which you would be permitted\n            to inspect and copy; or (d) not created by our practice, unless the\n            individual or entity that created the information is not available\n            to amend the information.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            <strong>5. Accounting of Disclosures.</strong> All of our patients\n            have the right to request an “accounting of disclosures.” An\n            “accounting of disclosures” is a list of certain non-routine\n            disclosures our practice has made of your IIHI for non-treatment,\n            non-payment or non-operations purposes. Use of your IIHI as part of\n            the routine patient care in our practice is not required to be\n            documented. For example, the doctor sharing information with the\n            nurse; or the billing department using your information to file your\n            insurance claim. In order to obtain an accounting of disclosures,\n            you must submit your request in writing to OFFICE MANAGER, 178\n            Hartford Road, Manchester, CT, 06040, Telephone 860-649-9973. All\n            requests for an “accounting of disclosures” must state a time\n            period, which may not be longer than six (6) years from the date of\n            disclosure and may not include dates before April 14, 2003. The\n            first list you request within a 12-month period is free of charge,\n            but our practice may charge you for additional lists within the same\n            12-month period. Our practice will notify you of the costs involved\n            with additional requests, and you may withdraw your request before\n            you incur any costs.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"text-section-paragraph\">\n            <strong>6.
